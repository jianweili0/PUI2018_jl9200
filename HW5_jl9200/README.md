## Homework 5



#### In Assignment 1, I make an getUrldata data to parse the [Pluto Zip](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) , then I unzip and move those folder into my PUIDATA folder. Then I groupby to count the building per LandUse code and drop other columns 


#### In Assignment 2, I work on the sql and query data form Carto Database. Thanks  Wenjie for helping me figureout the sql syntax for only chosing weekend data. I also find out in python3 we need to  use io.BytesIO instead of StringIO in python2
