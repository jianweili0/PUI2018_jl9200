# Question: 

"young women are likely than young men to choose biking in weekendsÂ¶"
Do you mean are "more likely" or "less likely"?
_needs clarification_

# NH:
"The proportion of young women ( age under 35) biking on weekends is the same or higher than the proportion of young men (age under 35)biking on weekend"

I think you mean the "fraction". 
If I understand the NH than the idea was that "young women are less likely than young man to bike on weekends" 
but compared to what? is this the fraction of women under 35 to all women (but only considering weekends)? or the fraction of women that bike on weekends over all women that bike any day of the week (limiting the analysis to age <35?)? please clarify!

Also, you should have some words about why it is interesting.

Also you are missing a formula for your null hypothesis
_needs clarification_

# Formula
your null hypothesis could be 
H0 : W_<35_weekends /W_anyage_weekends >= M<35_weekends / M_anyage_weekends

or 

H0 : W_<35_weekends / W_<35_anyday >= M_<35_weekends / M_<35_anyday

depending on what the question actually was

# DATA

the data is not fully prepared. Until you clarify rhe question you cannot process the data in the 4 groups you need:
either W all age, W < 35, M all age M < 35 only weekend trips ofr all, or 
W < 35 weekends, W < 35 any day, M < 35 weekends, M < 35 any day 

you basically copied my data reduction...

# TEST

either way this is a test for proportions: Z test or chi square test would be appropriate
